* The basic outline
Breaking down the patch into a series of levels, and then determining the objects that are in common at each level...

- top-level
  - initializes the "timing"
  - turns on and off "the process"
- second-level
  - contains pitch structures
  - contains the collective probability table(s)
- third-level
  - "audibilizes" the set chosen at level2
    - many little decisions have to be set in motion by the user
  - allows a wave file to be written


Note, development began on a new "pc-set2" section. No progress has been made.

* To get sound
At this stage, a lot of little fussy things have to be set in motion by the user.

* Keeping track of what is actually happening
Is, unfortunately, unreasonably difficult.

* Deeper analysis
