This contains work that I used as part of my contribution to the
International Computer Music Conference. The code is in Pure Data (and
is best viewed by opeing with the Pd app), and explores the concept
of atonal voice-leading and emergence in a generative composition
setting.

The documentation is in dire need of cleaning up!
